# 🎨 NFL AI Coach: UI Mockups

These are JS-only, high-fidelity mockups designed to validate the "Glanceable UX" requirements for the Head Coach, Offensive Coordinator, and Defensive Coordinator.

## 🚀 How to Run
Since these are pure HTML/CSS/JS, no build step or server is required.

1.  **Open locally:** Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox).
2.  **Navigation:** Use the top navigation bar (**HC, OC, DC**) to switch between persona views.
3.  **Interactions:** 
    -   **Head Coach:** Observe the "Traffic Light" decision engine.
    -   **Offensive Coord:** Tap any "Play Card" to trigger the **Send to QB** overlay.
    -   **Defensive Coord:** Observe the high-contrast "Radar" alerts.

## 📱 Design Principles
-   **Dark Mode:** High contrast for sideline visibility.
-   **No Scrolling:** Everything fits on one screen to avoid distraction.
-   **Color Semantics:** Red/Green/Yellow for instant decision making.
