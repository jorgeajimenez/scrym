# 4th Down Bot - Demo Guide

This guide explains how to use the built-in "Demo Mode" for a smooth and compelling presentation.

## Activating Demo Mode

-   **To Start:** Simply press the `D` key on your keyboard.
-   **To Stop:** Press the `D` key again.

## What it Does

When activated, Demo Mode will automatically cycle through three pre-scripted game scenarios. Each scenario will:

1.  **Set the Stage:** Update the UI to reflect a specific game situation (down, distance, time, etc.).
2.  **Show the Narrative:** Display a "Director's Cut" overlay that explains the current situation and what the AI is thinking.
3.  **Highlight a Play:** The AI's top recommended play will be highlighted.
4.  **Auto-Select:** After a few seconds, the highlighted play will be automatically selected, and the formation on the field will update.

The demo will loop through the scenarios until you stop it.

## Demo Flow

-   **Scenario 1:** A standard, early-down offensive play call.
-   **Scenario 2:** A high-pressure 4th down decision.
-   **Scenario 3:** A key defensive play to counter the opponent's tendency.

This automated flow allows you to focus on narrating the value of the tool without needing to manually click through every step.
